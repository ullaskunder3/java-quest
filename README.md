## Getting Started  

Welcome to the Visual Studio Code Java environment! This guide will help you set up and write Java code using VS Code.  

## Folder Structure  

Your workspace includes the following folders:  

- **src**: Contains the source code.  
- **lib**: Stores dependency libraries.  

Compiled output files are generated in the **bin** folder by default.  

> To customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and adjust the settings as needed.  

## Recommended VS Code Extensions  

To make Java development smoother in VS Code, install the following extensions:  

- **[Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)** â€“ Includes essential tools like language support, debugging, and project management.  
- **[Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug)** â€“ Allows you to set breakpoints and debug Java code.  
- **[Test Runner for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-test)** â€“ Helps run and debug JUnit tests.  
- **[Maven for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-maven)** â€“ Useful if you're managing dependencies with Maven.  

## Dependency Management  

Use the **JAVA PROJECTS** view in VS Code to manage dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).  

## About This Project  

Iâ€™m a frontend engineer working with web stacks like **MERN** and **Next.js**, but Iâ€™ve recently started exploring Java to build a stronger programming foundation. This repo is my way of learning Java at a steady paceâ€”without rushing but focusing on understanding things deeply.  

If you're also transitioning into Java or learning it alongside other technologies, I hope this helps! The goal is to keep things simple, practical, and enjoyable while covering core concepts like:  

- **Java Fundamentals** â€“ Variables, Control Flow, Methods, Loops  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** â€“ Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Interfaces  
- **Exception Handling & File I/O**  
- **Collections, Generics & Lambda Expressions**  
- **Multithreading & Concurrency Basics**  
- **Security Awareness in Java**  

This is a learning process, and Iâ€™m documenting my journey along the way. If youâ€™re also on a similar path, feel free to explore, contribute, or just follow along. Letâ€™s build a solid core, one step at a time. ðŸš€
